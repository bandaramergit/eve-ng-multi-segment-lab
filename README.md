# ðŸ§© EVE-NG Network Lab â€“ Multi-Segment Enterprise Topology

This project demonstrates a complete enterprise-style network design built in **EVE-NG**, integrating routers, switches, and servers to simulate real-world environments.

---

## ðŸ”§ Lab Overview
- **2 Routers (R1 & R2)** â€” running OSPF Multi-Area  
- **2 Switches (Core & Access)** â€” VLAN segmentation and inter-VLAN routing  
- **2 Servers (DHCP/DNS, Web/Backup)**  
- **3 PCs** â€” representing user endpoints  
- **Redundant Links** for high availability  

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
- Design a scalable enterprise network using EVE-NG  
- Implement **VLAN segmentation**, **OSPF**, and **redundancy**  
- Configure DHCP/DNS integration for automation and name resolution
